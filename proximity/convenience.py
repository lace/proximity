    Find the triangular faces on a mesh which are nearest to the given query
    points.

    Args:
        vertices (np.arraylike): The vertices of a mesh, as `kx3`.
        faces (np.arraylike): The face indices of a mesh, as `kx3`.
        query_points (np.arraylike): The points to query, with shape `kx3`
        ret_points (bool): When `True`, return both the indices of the
            nearest faces and the closest points to the query points, which
            are not necessarily vertices. When `False`, return only the
            face indices.

    Returns:
        object: Face indices as `kx1 np.ndarray`, or when `ret_points`
        is `True`, a tuple also including the coordinates of the closest points
        as `kx3 np.ndarray`.
